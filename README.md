# BusinessCard-Nano
A Functional Arduino Nano on a business card

While having some fun on EasyEDA, and also actually needing some new business cards, I decided to make a PCB style businesscard.
Having recently seen a very nice looking example online, I decided that that would be something nice to give to special customers,
if I ever get around to actually have it manufactured... definitely with my next order from JLCPCB, I will let them add this one as well

Just a PCB would however not work for me, So, I decided to add a functional Arduino Nano style circuit to the card as well. Basically ,
It is an Arduino Nano Clone, in businesscard form factor... I may actually have some assembled, or leave it up to the receiving party to 
decide if they want to assemble it or not... 

The source for the project is available here : https://easyeda.com/jean.redelinghuys/bussinescard or https://easyeda.com/editor#id=|25380718f6a842208303
and you can also have your own version made at JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com)
